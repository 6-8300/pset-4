# Problem 1: SIRENs

In this problem, you will learn the theory underlying Sine Representation Networks (SIRENs), and implement the model yourself. This exercise will serve as an introduction to both neural fields and computer vision research, as you will implement the model (along with many baselines) from scratch.

## Part 1: Understanding the Theory

For this part, start by reading the SIRENs paper:
> [*Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions*](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Implicit+Neural+Representations+with+Periodic+Activation+Functions) by Sitzmann and Martel et al., NeurIPS 2020

Next, answer all the multiple choice questions in `multiple_choice.yml` to test your reading comprehension.
